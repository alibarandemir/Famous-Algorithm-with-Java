### B-Tree

A **B-Tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

ðŸ”— [Go to B-Tree Implementation](./B-Tree)

### Breadth First Traversal (BFS)

**Breadth First Traversal** is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a selected node (usually the root) and explores all its neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of neighbors.

ðŸ”— [Go to BFS Implementation](./BreadthFirstTravel)

---

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It is widely used in network routing protocols and other applications requiring optimal pathfinding.

ðŸ”— [Go to Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation](./Dijkstra)

---

### Prim's Algorithm

**Prim's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. It adds nodes to the spanning tree one at a time from a set of candidate nodes.

ðŸ”— [Go to Prim's Algorithm Implementation](./Prim's)

---

### Trie (Prefix Tree)

A **Trie**, or prefix tree, is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. It's commonly used in applications like autocomplete and dictionary search.

ðŸ”— [Go to Trie Implementation](./Trie)
